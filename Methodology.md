 ##üß† Methodology

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preparation

Collected labeled image data for:

Sleep detection (2 classes: sleeping_person, awake_person)

Age prediction (95 classes for ages 1‚Äì95)

Organized datasets into Keras-compatible folder structures

Rescaled all images to 224x224 and normalized pixel values (0‚Äì1)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture

Used VGG16 (ImageNet pretrained) as frozen base for transfer learning

Sleep detection model:

VGG16 + GlobalAveragePooling2D + Dense(2, softmax)

Age prediction model:

VGG16 + GlobalAveragePooling2D + Dense(95, softmax)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Augmentation & Class Balancing

Augmented training data using:

Rotation, zoom, shifts, horizontal flip, brightness variation

Applied class weights (computed via sklearn) to handle imbalanced sleep/awake samples

4Ô∏è‚É£ Training & Evaluation

Trained each model using ImageDataGenerator

Sleep detection:

Epochs: 5, Metric: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

Age prediction:

Epochs: 3, Metrics: Top-1 and Top-5 Accuracy

5Ô∏è‚É£ Face Detection & Inference

Detected faces with OpenCV Haar Cascade

For each face:

Predicted sleep status

If sleeping, passed to age prediction model

6Ô∏è‚É£ GUI Interaction

Implemented a Tkinter GUI to upload images

Displays results (number of sleeping persons + predicted ages)

Designed for real-time, multi-face input scenarios
